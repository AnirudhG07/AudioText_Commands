# Audio and Text Commands Python

This repository will have various Audio to Text or vice-versa codes in python.
It uses various libararies of python. Some of them maybe slow and faster versions will be updated.

I have used AssemblyAI in some of the programs! Thanks for an easy-to-use model!

This repository is made to support me in my First Semester Self-Made Project.
It involves various uses of Audio, Text and how to output them side by side, etc.
